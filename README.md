# deck-of-cards
main.py starts the pygame deck of cards

A standard 52- card deck that deals one card at the time. Can be used for playing card games where one card is showed at the time (drinking games etc.)

I created this virtual deck as a quick mini project to learn about the basics of pygame. It was meant to be used over discord (or any other platform where you can share your screeen) when chatting with friends, or on a computer when there are no physical cards available

NOTE: There are no jokers in this deck
